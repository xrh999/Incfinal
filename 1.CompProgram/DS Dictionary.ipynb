Dictionaries are sometimes found in other languages as “associative memories” or “associative arrays”. Unlike sequences, which are indexed by a range of numbers, dictionaries are indexed by keys, which can be any immutable type; strings and numbers can always be keys. Tuples can be used as keys if they contain only strings, numbers, or tuples; if a tuple contains any mutable object either directly or indirectly, it cannot be used as a key. You can’t use lists as keys, since lists can be modified in place using index assignments, slice assignments, or methods like append() and extend().\n","\n","It is best to think of a dictionary as a set of key: value pairs, with the requirement that the keys are unique (within one dictionary). A pair of braces creates an empty dictionary: {}. Placing a comma-separated list of key:value pairs within the braces adds initial key:value pairs to the dictionary; this is also the way dictionaries are written on output.\n","\n","The main operations on a dictionary are storing a value with some key and extracting the value given the key. It is also possible to delete a key:value pair with del. If you store using a key that is already in use, the old value associated with that key is forgotten. It is an error to extract a value using a non-existent key."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"6b2abb45-64f3-4938-93b0-55c5ebb4fa76","metadata":{"id":"6b2abb45-64f3-4938-93b0-55c5ebb4fa76"},"source":["### Dictionary Literals\n","\n","Dictionaries are create using a comma-separated list of `key: value` pairs within braces."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"id":"372ba21b-a0c2-4a0c-af99-f79261a3e59d","metadata":{"id":"372ba21b-a0c2-4a0c-af99-f79261a3e59d"},"outputs":[],"source":["# Creating an empty dictionary\n","employees = { }\n","\n","# Creating a dictionary with 5 keys:values pairs\n","marks = { \"EL\": 80, \"CL\": 65, \"EM\": 75, \"AM\": 55, \"CP\": 44 }\n","\n","# accessing value\n","print(marks[\"EL\"])\n","\n","# accessing all values in dictionary using .items()\n","for key, value in marks.items():\n","    print(f\"{key}: {value}\")"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"id":"3fae04b5-aae2-49d8-9b23-fe26459f3b4b","metadata":{"id":"3fae04b5-aae2-49d8-9b23-fe26459f3b4b"},"outputs":[],"source":["#Check if a key is in dictionary\n","userinput = input('Enter subject: ')\n","if userinput in marks:\n","    print(f\"{userinput}: {marks[userinput]}\")\n","else:\n","    print(f\"{userinput} not found in data\")"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"id":"4c34365b-b103-4e9c-ac54-6812847ac00d","metadata":{"id":"4c34365b-b103-4e9c-ac54-6812847ac00d"},"outputs":[],"source":["# Add an item to dictionary\n","marks[\"GE\"] = 90\n","\n","for key, value in marks.items():\n","    print(f\"{key}: {value}\")"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"id":"015807f6-3a4b-423b-8033-fbd5a16948f8","metadata":{"id":"015807f6-3a4b-423b-8033-fbd5a16948f8"},"outputs":[],"source":["# Removing an item from dictionary\n","del marks[\"AM\"]\n","\n","for key, value in marks.items():\n","    print(f\"{key}: {value}\")\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"003fecfd-a106-4128-bb07-c69b76504c0f","metadata":{"id":"003fecfd-a106-4128-bb07-c69b76504c0f"},"source":["#### Practice Question 1: Count Word Frequency\n","Write a Python function that takes a string as input and returns a dictionary where the keys are words and the values are the number of times each word appears in the string.\n","\n","Example Input  \n","`\"hello hello there\"`  \n","Output:   \n","`\"hello\" 2`  \n","`\"there\" 1`"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"id":"c4cb0acf-3568-43c1-8de1-520069e5fb76","metadata":{"id":"c4cb0acf-3568-43c1-8de1-520069e5fb76"},"outputs":[],"source":["# Count word frequency\n","# Your code here\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"70884b3d-245a-4c9f-bc23-42cd5f1fc6ce","metadata":{"id":"70884b3d-245a-4c9f-bc23-42cd5f1fc6ce"},"source":["#### Practice Question 2: Group Students by Grades\n","Given a list of tuples where each tuple contains a student's name and their grade, write a function that groups students by their grades using a dictionary.\n","\n","Example Input  \n","`students = [(\"Alice\", \"A\"), (\"Bob\", \"B\"), (\"Charlie\", \"A\"), (\"David\", \"C\")]`  \n","Output  \n","`'A': ['Alice', 'Charlie']`  \n","`'B': ['Bob']`  \n","`'C': ['David']`\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"id":"1ff019b8-df4a-48b5-97cf-54f43e460c12","metadata":{"id":"1ff019b8-df4a-48b5-97cf-54f43e460c12"},"outputs":[],"source":["# Group Students by Grades\n","# Your code here\n"]}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3 (ipykernel)","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.12.5"},"colab":{"provenance":[]}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":5}
