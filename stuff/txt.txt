Nuclear fusion is a powerful energy source where two light atoms, like hydrogen, combine to form a heavier atom, such as helium, releasing a large amount of energy — just like how the Sun produces energy. To generate this energy on Earth, we use special devices like tokamak reactors, which use strong magnetic fields to contain super-hot plasma, or laser-based systems to compress fuel. The energy transfer process goes from nuclear energy to thermal, then kinetic, and finally into electrical energy using a heat exchanger, steam turbine, and generator. Fusion requires extreme conditions, such as temperatures above 100 million °C and strong magnetic fields to keep the plasma stable. The main advantages of fusion are that it produces no greenhouse gases, uses abundant fuel from water and lithium, and creates no long-term radioactive waste. It’s also very safe — fusion reactions are hard to start and easy to stop, so there’s no risk of a meltdown. Fusion is considered a renewable energy source because its fuel is practically unlimited. Environmentally, it is very clean, with minimal pollution and only small amounts of short-lived radiation from the reactor walls, which can be safely managed.
